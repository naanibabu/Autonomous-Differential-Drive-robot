# ðŸ¤– BumperBot ROS 2 Project

This project implements a mobile differential drive robot using ROS 2, featuring motor control, odometry computation, and sensor fusion using a Kalman Filter. It is designed to work in a simulation or real-world environment and is compatible with visualization tools like PlotJuggler.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- âœ… **Wheel-based velocity control** (converts `/cmd_vel` to wheel velocities)
- âœ… **Odometry calculation** using wheel encoders
- âœ… **TF broadcasting** (`odom â†’ base_footprint`)
- âœ… **Sensor fusion** with IMU using a **Kalman Filter**
- âœ… **Data visualization** using PlotJuggler
